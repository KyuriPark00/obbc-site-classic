                    <p>We believe in obedience to the Biblical commands to separate entirely from worldliness and ecclesiastical apostasy unto God. <i>II Corinthians 6:14 - 7:1; 1 Thessalonians 1:9; 1 Timothy 6:3 - 5; Romans 16:17; II John 1:9-11</i></p>

                    <p>We believe that civil government is of divine appointment for the interest and good order of human society; that magistrates are to be prayed for, and obeyed, except in things opposed to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ; that the church and state are to be separate, each having definite and distinct spheres of responsibility. <i>Romans 13:1-7; II Samuel 23:3, Exodus 18:21, 22; Acts 5:29, 4:19, 20; Daniel 3:17, 18</i></p>

                    <p>We believe in the imminent premillennial return of Christ for His Church and that at that moment the dead in Christ shall be raised in glorified bodies, and the living in Christ shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air before the seventieth week of Daniel. <i>Daniel 9:24-27; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44; 51-54; Philippians 3:20, 21; Revelation 3:10</i></p>

                    <p>We believe that the Great Tribulation, which follows the rapture of the church, will be culminated by the revelation of Christ in power and great glory to sit upon the throne of David and to establish the millennial reign. <i>Acts 2:29, 30; Revelation 20:1-4, 6</i></p>
